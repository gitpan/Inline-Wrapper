Inline-Wrapper

Inline::Wrapper provides wrapper routines to make embedding another
language into a Perl application more convenient.

Instead of having to include the external code after __END__ in your Perl
source code, you can have separate, individually-configurable language
module directories to contain and organize all of your code.


Inline::Wrapper provides the following features:

* Transparent support for all languages supported by Inline.pm
* A single, unified interface for loading and running module functions.
* Loading of files containing pure source code, only in their respective
        languages, so you can isolate maintenance and management of these
        modules.
* Individually-configurable module directories.
* Automatic, run-time module reloading upon file modification time
        detection.
* No more namespace pollution.  All module symbols are loaded into their own
        individual, private namespaces, so they won't collide with your code
        or each other.
