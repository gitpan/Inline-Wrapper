Inline-Wrapper

Inline::Wrapper provides wrapper routines to make embedding another
language into a Perl application more convenient.

Instead of having to include the external code in after __END__ in Perl
source code, you can have separate, individually configurable language
module directories to contain all of your code.


Inline::Wrapper provides the following features:

* Support for all languages that Inline.pm supports.
* A single, unified interface to running loaded module functions.
* Loading of files containing pure source code, only in their respective
    language.
* Individually configurable module directories.
* Automatic, run-time module reloading upon file modification time
    detection.
* No more namespace pollution.

See the Changes file for release information.
