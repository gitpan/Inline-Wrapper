        NEW: Added Inline::Wrapper->unload() method to unload modules, and
            corresponding tests.
        FIX: Corrected behaviour whereby if you load()ed a module, then used
            add_language() to change the file extension, AND the module had
            been set to auto_reload, unless you renamed the underlying file
            also, The Bad Thing(tm) happened.  Phew.
        FIX: Inline::Wrapper::Module->_delete_namespace didn't work.  Fixed.
        FIX: Changed all warn()s to carp()s.  Duh.
        DOC: Updated all docs to new POD style.  Better and easier to follow.
